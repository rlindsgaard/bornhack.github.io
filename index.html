        <p>Bornhack is a camp where hackers, makers and people
        with an interest in technology come together for a week
        to celebrate technology, socialise and have fun.</p>

        <p>It takes place for the first time from <b>August
        27 to September 3rd 2016</b> on the Danish island Bornholm
        where we have found the geography as well as the backbone
        to make it happen.</p>


        <p>Bornhack is a participatory event where we expect
        people to come up with crazy ideas and help make the
        content. We will try to attract interesting people to
        give talks and make workshops, but this is just a
        setting - you make the content.</p>

        <p>We hope you will show your interest by signing onto
        our mailing-list as soon as we get it up. In the meantime
        you are very much welcome to ask questions and show your
        interest on IRC at <b>#bornhack</b> on <b>irc.freenode.net</b>
        such that you can help us understand what <i>you</i>
        think would be fun to do. This is a new event, so we don't
        yet know exactly where this is going - but give us your
        feedback and you can help us form it.</p>

        <p>We hope you want to be a part of Bornhack - the Initial
        commit</p>

        <p>Sincerely<br>
        The Bornhack Team
